# rust-tcp-chat
Simple P2P CLI chat written in rust. Built for learning purposes.

TODOs:
- Improve CLI Design.
- Add P2P encryption (Physically shared symetric keys could be used as an additional feature).
- Show connection status.
- Small file attachments (With integrity checks, encryption, etc..).
